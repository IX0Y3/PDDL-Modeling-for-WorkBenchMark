# 🧱 PDDL Modeling for WorkBenchMark

**Project P1** — AI for Robotics, Summer Semester 2026 (RWTH Aachen)

Design a PDDL domain for LEGO Duplo assembly, plan with a general-purpose
planner, and execute in [TAMPanda](../tampanda) via `DomainBridge`.

## 🧭 What This Project Does

WorkBenchMark ships an Assembly-by-Disassembly (ABD) baseline. We model the
assembly task symbolically in PDDL and let a classical planner produce the
sequence. The generated plan is executed in TAMPanda through `DomainBridge`
and `PickPlaceExecutor`.

Pipeline: **YAML task spec → PDDL problem → planner → action plan → MuJoCo execution**

## 🎯 Scope

What we must deliver, what we aim for if time allows, and what we explicitly leave out.

### ✅ Minimal Requirements
- Tier 1 (2-brick) and Tier 2 (3–5 brick) vertical stacks
- Ground-truth poses from YAML (no perception)
- MuJoCo simulation via TAMPanda
### 🚀 Goal
- PDDL domain designed for Tier 3 up front (stud-grid poses, rotation,
`can-attach` / footprint geometry) — no rewrite later
- Tier 3 (3D layouts, half-overlap, multi-column) if time allows
- Compare planning time and plan quality against the ABD baseline
### 🚫 Not Part of the Project
- Tier 4 complex interlocking assemblies
- Real-robot experiments
- Perception stack (GroundingDINO, SAM, FoundationPose, …)
- Modifying TAMPanda itself



## 🗺️ Phases


| Phase                  | Goal                                                                        | Status         |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **1 — Setup**          | Repo, `pyproject.toml`, package skeleton, env smoke tests                   | ✅ done         |
| **2 — Symbolic layer** | `lego_domain.pddl`, YAML parser, problem generator                          | 🚧 in progress |
| **3 — Execution**      | `DomainBridge` wiring, predicate grounding, motion executors                | ⏳ pending      |
| **4 — Evaluation**     | Batch runner, metrics vs. ABD, failure analysis (Tier 1–2; Tier 3 optional) | ⏳ pending      |


**Phase 2 deliverables:** 
- stud-grid PDDL domain with `pick` / `place` / `stack`
- Tier‑3-ready predicates YAML parser for WorkBenchMark `blocks[]` specs
- problem generator from initial + goal YAML.

**Phase 3 deliverables:** 
- map PDDL actions to `PickPlaceExecutor` calls in TAMPanda
- ground symbolic stud/layer/rot poses to continuous YAML poses

**Phase 4 deliverables:** 
- systematic evaluation on Tier 1–2 (N = 20 tasks per tier)
- planning/execution success, time, plan length vs. ABD
- Tier 3 evaluation if implementation of it is completed.
- Failure analysis.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- ✅ **Planning success** — planner finds a valid plan
- 🤖 **Execution success** — all actions succeed in TAMPanda
- ⏱️ **Planning time & plan length** — vs. ABD baseline where available
- 🔍 **Failure analysis** — which task structures expose model gaps
